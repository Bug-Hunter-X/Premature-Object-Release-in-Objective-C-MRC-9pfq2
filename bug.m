In Objective-C, a less common error stems from misuse of the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` methods in manual memory management (MRC).  Specifically, the error may arise when an object is released prematurely (before all its references are relinquished), leading to a crash or unexpected behavior. This is especially insidious when dealing with complex object graphs and callbacks.
