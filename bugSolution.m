The solution involves careful management of object lifetimes and ensuring that `release` is called only when the object is no longer needed.  Common strategies include:

* **Using `@property` with appropriate attributes:**  Using `@property (retain)` ensures proper retain/release handling. Use `@property (copy)` for immutable objects to avoid unexpected behaviour. 
* **Strong references:** In ARC (Automatic Reference Counting), strong references automatically manage memory.
* **Proper use of delegates and callbacks:**  Make sure to avoid retaining objects in callbacks if not necessary.
* **Using `autorelease` pools effectively:**  Avoid placing objects in autorelease pool for a long time.
